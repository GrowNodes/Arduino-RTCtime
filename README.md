# RTCtime by smz

An Arduino Real Time Clock library.  

This library makes using the DS1307 and DS3231 RTC module really easy and is compatible with the classic <time.h> datatypes and methods.

Forked from the excelent "Rtc by Makuna" library (https://github.com/Makuna/Rtc), this one uses different datatypes/classes for handling time. While the Makuna library uses the proprietary RtcDateTime class, this one uses the classic time.h datatypes/classes. There are also some minor differences with the names and types of a few methods. Extra features (such as temperature reading, calibration, alarms and memory storage) are available when supported by the module used.

Supports esp8266.

Supports SoftwareWire library.

## Installing this library (prefered method)
Using your Arduino IDE, open the Library Manager, search for "RTCtime by smz" and install.

## Installing this library from GitHub (alternative method)
Create a directory named "RTCtime" in your Arduino\libraries folder.

Clone this project into that folder.  

It should now be available in your Arduino IDE "Include Library" list.

## Examples

Examples will soon be added, please bear with me...
